ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Kim Bergstrom, an experienced professional transitioning into a career in software development with a focus on building "server-side" applications.

ðŸ’» With over a decade of experience working with quality management systems, particularly in support of nuclear-related projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory, I have honed my ability to tackle complex problems and break them down into manageable pieces. I thrive on collaborating with teams to find creative and streamlined solutions. 

âœ¨ I'm passionate about improving organizational efficiency and performance, and I'm excited to apply my skills and knowledge to a new industry. I'm eager to join a dynamic company that values creativity, collaboration, and a culture of friendship, understanding, humor, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making as we work together towards shared goals.

ðŸš€ If your organization is seeking a software engineer with a sense of humor, integrity, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, I would love to chat! Feel free to reach out; I'm always open to engaging in meaningful conversations. Let's connect and explore exciting opportunities together!
